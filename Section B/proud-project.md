The project I am proudest of is called QuotePad.  It is still quite a work-in-progress (and, worse still, a WIP I haven't worked on for a couple of months now...).  Ultimately, I am trying to build a mobile app that I can use to store and organise my favourite quotes.  It has also been a project where I toyed around with different technologies, e.g. Jest for my test suite.  It isn't my best-documented or even best-structured piece of work, but I am proudest of it because it was my first real foray back into coding after having spent some time as a Maths teacher, and it reminded me just how magical the process of creation is, how much power and imagination coding unlocks, and that enthused me both for future coding work and any prospects to help other people acquire coding skills too.  Here's where you can view my progress so far:
* [Live demo](https://quotepad.netlify.app) _(disclaimer: demo might die in the next few days because Heroku is asking me to pay them to host the backend and I haven't decided what I want to do about that...)_
* [Frontend code in Ionic/Vue](https://github.com/stahfacedquail/quotes-lib)
* [Backend code using ExpressJS](https://github.com/stahfacedquail/quotepad-server)
