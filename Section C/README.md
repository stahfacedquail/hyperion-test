# Welcome to "Say the number!"
This is a simple program meant to help you say numbers (especially those very long ones!) in English.  It has a basic UI where you can enter any integer from 0 up to (but not including) a quadrillion, and it will output how to say that number.

## Setup
This project assumes you have Node installed (I can only vouch for v16).
To run this project locally, run this command:
```
npm ci
```
and then
```
npm run start
```
which will set up an HTTP server that lets you access the program on `127.0.0.1:8080` \\(",)/

## Tests
To run the test suite:
```
npm run test
```
